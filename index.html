                <p>Do you struggle with reaching your goals? One thing that makes goals so difficult to achieve is that
                    it’s hard to stay
                    focused enough to keep working towards them. Many of us blame distractions such as work, family, or
                    technology and say
                    that’s the reason why we have a hard time concentrating on our goals.</p>

                could leave. Your program won’t reach as many young people as it could.</p>
